\title{Split a poparray by a dimension}
\usage{
\method{split}{poparray}(x, f, drop = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A poparray.}

\item{f}{The dimension to split by: either a single dimension name (character
scalar) or a single integer position.}

\item{drop}{Logical; whether to drop dimensions in the subset, passed to \code{[}.}

\item{...}{Unused.}
}
\value{
A named list of poparray (or DelayedArray) slices.
}
\description{
Splits a poparray into a named list of slices, one per label of a chosen
dimension. This method preserves laziness by subsetting the delayed backend.
}
\details{
If \code{drop = FALSE} (default), each element is a \code{poparray}. If \code{drop = TRUE}
and the split dimension is the time or area role (per \code{dimroles}), each slice
will drop that role and the result elements will be a subsetted \code{DelayedArray}
objects as the time and area roles are required for a poparray.
