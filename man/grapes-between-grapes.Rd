\title{Infix range helper for tidy predicates}
\usage{
x \%between\% rng
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector or a dimension symbol used inside a filtering expression.}

\item{rng}{A length-2 vector giving lower and upper bounds. Order does not
matter; \code{c(44, 25)} is treated the same as \code{c(25, 44)}.}
}
\value{
A logical vector when evaluated in normal R contexts.
When used inside \code{filter.poparray()}, the expression is captured and interpreted
by the method (so it will not be evaluated in the usual way).
}
\description{
\verb{\%between\%} is a small infix helper intended for use inside \code{filter()} calls.
It returns a call of the form \code{x \%between\% c(lower, upper)} that downstream
methods (e.g., \code{filter.poparray()}) interpret as an inclusive range constraint.

For \code{poparray}:
\itemize{
\item \code{year \%between\% c(2010, 2020)} selects years 2010–2020 (inclusive).
\item \code{age.char \%between\% c(25, 44)} selects age labels whose intervals overlap
ages 25–44 (inclusive; half-open target [25, 45)).
}
}
\examples{
# Base usage on vectors:
5 \%between\% c(1, 10)
c(1, 5, 11) \%between\% c(1, 10)

# Typical intended usage (captured by filter.poparray()):
# dplyr::filter(pop, year \%between\% c(2015, 2020))
# dplyr::filter(pop, age.char \%between\% c(25, 44))
