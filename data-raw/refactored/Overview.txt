THe refacgored data_raw scripts build the HDF5AArray cubes.  THis refactor is meant to remove the un0necessary complixity found in the 
current build scripts.

This set uses a list of arr diemnsions to format the data into on disk HDF5Arrays.   The file naming scheme used is the
recent build scripts will remain.

The dim_name_defintions.r script hols the dimension and names uised for each dataset.
A separate script uses the spec and builds a lisy for generating the HDF5Array files
